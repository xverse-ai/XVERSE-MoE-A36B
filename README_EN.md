## Update Information
- **[2024/09/13]** Released **XVERSE-MoE-A36B** MoE base model, the Chat version model will be released later.

## Model Introduction

**XVERSE-MoE-A36B** is a multilingual large language model, independently developed by Shenzhen Yuanxiang Technology which is using Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. The total parameter scale of the model is 255 billion, with an actual number of activated parameters being 36 billion. The models released this time is the base model **XVERSE-MoE-A36B**. Its key features are as follows:

- **Model Structure**: XVERSE-MoE-A36B uses the mainstream Decoder-only Transformer network structure that extends the FFN layer of dense models to expert layers. Unlike traditional MoE model where each expert has the same size as standard FFN (such as Mixtral 8x7B), it uses more fine-grained experts, with each expert being 1/4 the size of a standard FFN. It includes shared experts and non-shared experts, where shared experts are always activated during computation, and non-shared experts are selectively activated through a Router.
- **Training Data**: The model has been thoroughly trained on a large-scale high-quality dataset, including more than 40 languages such as Chinese, English, Russian, and Spanish. The sampling ratio of different types of data is finely set, which makes the performance of Chinese and English excellent, and also takes into account the effect of other languages; The model is trained using training samples of length 8k; During the model training process, several data switches were made to dynamically introduce continuously processed high-quality data, along with adjustments to the data sampling ratio.
- **Training Strategy**: While switching data, corresponding adjustments were also made to the learning rate scheduler to ensure the model could quickly and thoroughly learn from the newly introduced data.
- **Training Framework**: We conducted in-depth customized optimization for the unique expert routing and weight calculation logic in the MoE model, developed an efficient fusion operator to improve computational efficiency. At the same time, to address the challenges of high memory consumption and communication volume in the MoE model, we designed a processing method for overlapping computation, communication, and CPU-Offload to increase overall throughput.

The models sizes, architectures and learning rate of **XVERSE-MoE-A36B** are showed as follows:

## Model Evaluation

To comprehensively assess the performance of the model, we conducted extensive testing across a range of standard datasets, including MMLU, C-Eval, CMMLU, RACE-M, PIQA, GSM8K, Math, MBPP and HumanEval. And compared it with open-weight MoE and Dense models (Base) of similar parameter scales, as well as closed-source Chat models. The results are as follows:
